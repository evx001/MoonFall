- Skyway -

The girl 
sleeps, 
	head slumped against the passenger window of the blue Honda 
		rushing along the I-5 Skyway outside Samarra New York.   


In the girl's dream: 
she is in a bedroom, 
in a composite house 
pulled together from bits of others 
they've lived in; 
the girl snatches up an angel-figurine from the nativity-set on the bureau just before an arm, a spectral arm, 
sweeps the entire scene into a garbage bag. 
“We don't have time,” 
says the disembodied 
mother-like voice. 

The blue Honda hits the railing; 
the girl is jolted up through dream-layers 
absently touching at the scar on her forehead, 
like she did, 
when she rode the Whirlygig ride at the County fair, 
last summer, 
the summer before they'd had to move again, 
in the middle of the night,
 
always, the middle of the night,

Outside the dream:

The blue Honda launches out of the southbound lane of the I-5 Skyway 
	into the open space above treetops.

- Sky -

Earth and sky change places for the girl in the blue Honda, 
in a tumble,	 
like laundry in the dryer 
		air rushing in.
Air, 
across the cheek,
Air, 
from an open window?
Air
from a missing door?  
“MOM?”

Hours later, against a blue dawn sky, at the gap in the railing where the car went over; State-Trooper Mallory will look down into the clump of shattered pine trees and mashed blue metal, that used to be a 1999 Honda Civic, (identifiable only by the name-plate on the trunk) and fill out his report.  

- Earth -

The girl 
touching at that indelible scar, (her “central” defect) 
on her forehead, 
like she’s crossing herself
but she isn’t crossing herself, 
she’s flailing 
screaming 
or she thinks she's screaming, 
screaming 
in her mind, 
screaming 
in her heart, 
but hearts can't scream, 		can they?

Down the blue Honda
rolls, & twists, 
through pine branches,
disgorging its driver, 
enfolding its remaining passenger,
as it slams into the night earth.
