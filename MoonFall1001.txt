She sits forward on the sofa, 
    as if ready to spring to her feet and leave. 
    "I shouldn't have to be here." she says. 

"No one should have to be anywhere," says the man who sits opposite, 
"but sometimes...." he trails off, not finishing his sentence.
He's a man dressed for a casual interview. 
Solitary gray hairs are perceptible in his close cut beard. 
His chair, an office chair, comfortable but for work at a desk.
He has wheeled it away from the desk 
to set directly opposite the girl perched on the sofa. 

"I was fine before this," she says, and digs at the cuticle on her thumb with her middle finger. A redness is developing there, close to becoming an open wound.

"I'm sure," he says "we're always fine until we aren't. Then with time...."
Again he trails off.

"No I mean it. My grades were perfect. I ..." she seeks words but they are 
    no longer available to her.

He nods, leans forward, uncrosses his legs, 
his pad of paper almost slips from his lap 
but he catches it without breaking eye contact with her.
