When I was stolen. The how, the why, I do not remember, I was too young, and all that was before, erased, a wiped blackboard, only chalk smears;  memory(souvenir). It is rather as a dream, a distant, terrible nightmare, that returns at certain nights, which disturbs me even in the day. There is this street white with sun, dusty and empty, the blue sky, the heart-rending shout of a black bird, and suddenly man's hands which throw(cast) me at the bottom of a big bag, and I suffocate(suppress). It is Lalla
Asma who bought me.

That is why I do not know my real name, the one that my mother gave me to my birth, neither the name of my father, nor the place where I was born. All that I know, it is what told me
Lalla Asma, that I arrived at her home(with her) one night, and for it she called me La√Øla, a Night.
I come from the South, from a great distance(by very far), maybe from the country which does not exist any more. For me, there was nothing 11 1
Vant, just this dusty street, the black bird, and the bag.

Then I became deaf in one ear.
That passed while I played in the street, in front of the door of the house. A small van banged me, and broke me a bone in the left(awkward) ear.
