When I was stolen. The how, the why, I don't remember, I was too young, and all that was before, erased, a wiped blackboard, leaving only chalk smears;  
memory is a dream, distant, terrible nightmare, that returns and returns at night, which disturbs, even in the day. 

There is this field bleached dry with the sun, all dusty and empty, the blue sky, the heart-rending shout of a black bird, and suddenly man's hands which throw me to the bottom of a big bag, a suffocating bag.
Who are these people that bought me.

That is why I do not know my real name, the one that I should have had at birth. All that I know, it is what was told to me. I don't believe them.  

Am I from the South? Am I from the north? From some great distance, maybe from the country which does not exist any more. For me, there was nothing just this dusty plain  and a bag to be stuffed into.

Then I became deaf in one ear.
That passed while I played in the street, in front of the door of the house. A small van banged me, and broke me a bone in the left(awkward) ear.

Afraid of the dark, night terror. I smelt of fear, a cold snake of it.
I didn't breathe. When I couldn't stand it any longer  I ran to the bed of the one who occupied the position of mother.
