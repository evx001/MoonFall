	By the Banks of Blood Run Creek.

The girl 
in a field of grass and weed bordered by a creek;
the iron in the soil makes the water red 
the creek has no name 
so she names it;
"Blood-Run-Creek" 

above her, clouds
white against blue
they come one at a time driven by wind
bunching up like a quilt.

The sun is warm,
warm on her,
but goes behind a cloud 
but then comes out again; 
for her.
She casts off long coat that conceals her 
and hikes up the skirt that runs down to her ankles 
trailing in the grass 
getting mud stained down in the creek-wet red earth;

ants   
quick and so many 
from a hole in the ground 
they come out to look up at her 
she is giant above them 
she picks up a branch

STAFF
She digs the stick in the ground, 
scratches a circle a yard around the mound.
Ants  she says,  I give you this land and no other.  
She pokes the mound with her stick
perhaps to get their attention
dozens of fighter ants rush up and out of the hole
to challenge her
she picks up a red-black one 

JOSHUA 
I call you Joshua Ant
and I make this covenent with you 
obey me and this land is yours;  
she gestures to the field.
Joshua Ant tries to pincher bite her finger,
do not anger me Joshua Ant, for I am . . . 
Girl-Sky-G-d! 

PROPHESY 
Joshua Ant keeps pinching at her finger. 
If you do not heed my will . . . 
I WILL LAY WASTE TO YOU AND ALL YOUR KIND! 
Joshua Ant, feelers waving, again bites at her.
Let it be SO!
She crushes Joshua Ant;
Ant guts smear her fingers 
she flicks the remains into the creek.

APOCALYPSE
she looks down at the ants running 
in circles; Do they sense their Doom? 
she raises her foot 
and smashes it down on dozens of them
some are crushed 
but others pull themselves out of the dirt 
feelers waving up at her
she lifts her foot to stomp again
and again;  
tired, she stops.  

NEW EARTH
Those still alive I shall spare thee, 
but let this be a lesson unto thee;
for I am Girl-Sky-G-d and from this day forward 
you will always know of me 

sun waning, 
Girl-Sky-G-d goes back 
across the field

She looks back over her domain 
and then goes in for supper.
