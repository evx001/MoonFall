	By the Banks of Blood Run Creek.

The girl 
in a field of grass and weed bordered by a creek;
the iron in the soil makes the water red 
the creek has no name 
so she names it;
"Blood-Run-Creek" 

above her, clouds
white against blue
they come one at a time driven by wind
bunching up like a quilt.

The sun is warm,
warm on her,
but goes behind a cloud 
but then comes out again; 
for her.
She casts off the long coat that hides her 
She hikes up the skirt that brushes her ankles  
she gets mud stained down in the creek-wet earth;

ants   
quick and many 
from a hole in the ground 
they come out to look up at her. 
She is giant above them 
picked up branch is recast as a 

STAFF
She digs the stick in the ground, 
scratches a circle a around the mound.
I give you this land and no other, she says.    
She pokes the mound with her stick
perhaps to get their attention
dozens of fighters rush up out of the hole
she picks up a red-black one 

JOSHUA 
I call you Joshua 
and I make this covenent with you 
obey me and this land is yours;  
she gestures to the field.
Joshua tries to pincher bite her finger,
do not anger me Joshua Ant, for I am . . . 
Girl-Sky-G-d! 

PROPHESY 
Joshua pinches again at her finger. 
If you do not heed my will . . . 
I WILL LAY WASTE TO YOU AND YOUR KIND! 
Joshua Ant, feelers waving, again bites at her.
Let it be SO!
She crushes Joshua Ant;
smearing ant guts  between her fingers 
she flicks the remains into the creek.

APOCALYPSE
she looks down at the ants running 
in circles;  
she raises her foot 
and smashes it down over and over
some are crushed 
but others pull themselves out of the dirt 
feelers waving up at her
she lifts her foot to stomp again
and again;  
but tires and stops.  

NEW EARTH
"Those alive I shall spare thee, 
and let this be a lesson for all time;
for I am Girl-Sky-G-d and from this day forward 
you will always know of me 

sun waning, 
Girl-Sky-G-d goes back 
across the field

picks up here discarded coat  
and goes in for supper.
