Likewise, you should typically avoid explicit recursion if an operator that captures the pattern of recursion being used is available. 
. For example, many explicit loops and recursive functions can be replaced by uses of functions such as List.map and Array.map. 
Watch for non-termination
You should always check your recursive calls to ensure that the function is tending toward terminationâ€”that is, that the arguments are approaching the base case. This is called well-founded recursion.
