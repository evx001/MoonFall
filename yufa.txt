yufa.txt
The Chinese term for grammar "yufa" is more transparent in meaning.  "Yu" is language and "fa" is law.
"No grammar" = "no rules."
Chinese does not have the kind of grammar that is familiar to speakers of English and other European languages.
	no verbal inflections, 
	no gender, 
	number and case endings for nouns, 
	no tense
