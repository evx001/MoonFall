              into awake, 
awake to: 
	tubes, 
	nose tubes, 
	mouth tubes, 
	stuck in the arm tubes. 

Tubes like so many roads 
	leading into 
		and out of her. 

A city of 
tubes, 
beeping, whirring, with machine breathing sounds. 

A room? 
	a blue room
	 		      dimmed.  

Squinty bright light beyond
	leaking in. 


Bright blur shapes, 
    outlines of things.

she can't move, 
an elephant weight on her legs, 
	her arms, 
	her chest. 

She tries to speak but her mouth is full of tube, 
holding down her words, 
forcing dry scratchy air, 
down inside her. 

Speakless, 
she jerks her middle and the plastic pipes 
running into, 
running through her; 
they tap against their own metal parts, 
tapping like a clock ticking. 

An itch burn forms in her eye, 
she can feel tape pulling at the corners, 
tape all around 
her head taped, 
held together.
As she struggles a pain throb threatens 
to split her apart. 

A sleep tendril 
creeps up and wraps around her thinking pain and tugs it down 
into merciful blackness.
