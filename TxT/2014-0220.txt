Saturday the cat dies, 
they bundle it in sweater
to keep the warmth from escaping
the woman carries it in her coat 
after they return from the vet
the apartment is empty, quiet.

The woman sits down on the futon where 
	the cat would join them
		climbing up onto the armrest  
		and on up to the highest point
		to look down at them. 


The woman rocks back and forth
and begin the sobbing 
her partner brings tea
	puts a blanket around her
	sits with her all day 
until evening shadows the room.  

the woman whimpers on,
until it's time for bed.
her partner curls into the spot 
at the foot of bed the cat used to take.
Finally, the woman drops off to sleep.
