I'm about to launch a super intensive class, 
codeCabal. In 4 sessions of about 100 min each, 
on four successive weekends, 
I will to take a small group of absolute noobs from 0 to 60. 
The result, they'll have everything they need for the entire picture. 
Plus, they will have coded with the sharpest tools in the shed.

All these developer boot camps give a narrow picture in a follow the herd, vocational training approach. They end up teaching spell casting not coding. 
Plus they flood the market with drones, who are more dangerous than useful.

With codeCabal, you get the entire picture; 
the flat earth becomes round.
You can then go anywhere; 
You can drill down on mobile or take on Big Data. 
You won't  be bound to where you started. 
You can lead the herd out of the marsh instead of drowning along with them. 
You can then talk to devs on an equal footing, they won't be able to blow smoke up your ass because you aren't a noob anymore. 

Why absolute noobs? 

Because I can take them from Noob to intermediate in 4 intense sessions the faster than if they have to unlearn what they know; because unlearning is way harder than learning. 

Why codeCabal? Because this amounts to secret info. Once revealed you can't see the programming universe the same way again. These concepts are ultra high level they are inconcievable to the herd. Worse, the herd won't understand what you are talking about if you tried to tell them. Most coders are average at what they do and worse do no learning outside of work, so if there boss doesn't tell they never go there. 
But you will know where they are coming from, in some ways better than they do.
 
So any dabbler, noob, project-manager, non-tech-founder etc, 
who wants to go from 0 to 60 send them my way.
