RenderMe

done
	with the will of God, 
	with everything binding 

renderMe 
	a cold flame, a dagger,
 
This persistent 
	disease, abounding
	worm light. 

To be done
	with the will of all 
	of time
	of motion 

parched world,
petrified  world,

To be done
	with presence 
	with absence 

renderMe 
	flameless in the burning world 

Toggled 
	neutral 
	but desirous 

Burnt 
	through 
	ossified alive 

In
	land bound desert 
	ablaze night sky clouded by a moon
	distant but dazzling
	falling limitless 
	between mesomorphic stones
	a candle, 
	a lone flicker
	pulling apart 
	a last energy
Now
	quiet earth
	over-top
	tendrils down
	heat 
	and
	hidden menace 

Closed over, 
	my breath slips out 
	to the surface 
	to the sky
	to the moon's inhale.
