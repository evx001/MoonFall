THE PRISONER WILL PLEASE STAND!

Funny, it's Sarah's face I see, like she was that first day out front on the bench, 
eating an egg sandwich, on her lunch break, just outside the courthouse, 
the one she worked in, the one the judge later pronounced us man and wife in, 
the one I'm standing in right now as same judge reads my sentence.  
Sarah's laughing, why not it's kind of funny really. 
We were so happy back then. I was working at Mike's Muffler, 
and she would make me those egg sandwiches for lunch. 
Shaking in a bit of cayenne pepper to make it spicy, that was Sarah. 
I wish she was here now, she would tell me what I should say when it's my turn, she was good with words, way better than me. 
Me I'm good with wrenches, pulling things apart, too good at pulling things apart because we came apart, her and me.

HAVING BEEN FOUND GUILTY IN THE ABOVE AND TITLED ACTION;

I was up stairs that morning, the morning they came. Pounding on the door. I didn't hear them. They could have pounded all day. I was dead to the world. But they came in, came through the door. First thing I know, Collison that son of a bitch, landing on me. I'm face down on the bed, I'm not doing anything I'm just lying there and he lands on me knocking us both to the floor. I got face full of carpet and then I throwed up, almost choked on it right then and there. My head is ringing, there must have been ten of them all shouting in that tiny attic bedroom. And Collison the son of a bitch, on top of me. I can't breath, and I black out. 			
			- FIVE - 
I SHALL PRONOUCE SENTENSE, HERE AND NOW.

I look over at my attorney, she's a little older than Sarah was, but she looks young. This is her first capital case, she told me that. Too bad for her it's all fucked. She tried to get the confession thrown out. "Diminished capacity," she'd said. That's the sort of thing Sarah would have come up with, she could talk legal alright.    

			- SEVEN - 
. . . TAKEN WHERE YOU WILL REMAIN UNTIL SENTENCE IS CARRIED OUT . . . 
Funny how the judges' voice booms through the court room. Every eye on me. Everyone thinking I'm getting what I deserve. And maybe I do deserve it, for being so fucking stupid.
