		Pill

I thought I would choke to death before she got home.
A stupid, white chalky thing stuck in the throat. 
I had swallowed a bunch, 
a handful,
the usual. 
Nothing inordinate, in the amount or the time or ...
but one found a ledge. 
Like a climber falling saved, by an outcrop.
And there it clung. 
For life 
or to it, 
not even the full dose, it was just a half. 
And it clung. 
Drink something, it thought. 
Eat something. 
But it all went rushing by, as if
it were tucked under the waterfall behind Niagara.
Cough!
So I did. 
And up came some chalky aspirin paste 
to spit up on the carpet like the cat throwing up.
The burn, the bad taste. 
My larynx, fried. 
All this before my sweetie is due home from tour any minute. 
And the reunion will be spoiled for a pill. 
I'll still coughing and choking when she arrives and it wont be a heartfelt enough return and our relationship will suffer and ...
